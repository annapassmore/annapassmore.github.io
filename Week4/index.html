            <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, and lived here until the age of 14 
        when I moved accross the country to attend boarding school in Victoria,
        British Columbia. I shortly returned to Ottawa following my grade 10 year. 
        I have been a competitive irish dancer since I was 8 competing around North 
        America in places like Toronto, New York, and Boston.  
    </p>
    <p>I was also a concert pianist since I was 7 which lead to doing Royal Conservatory
        practical and theory exams achieving honours in all exams. I sadly had to quit 
        both dance and piano after my 10<sup>th</sup> year due to school and work. But I have since found
        ways to stay in shape and keep me busy. Whenever I find the chance, I will still
        dance at my home or play piano for fun. As well as I now bury myself in work and
        found a new love for the gym.
